This is [Patchethium](https://github.com/Patchethium)'s blog. I post speech synthesis, generative modeling, software development and whatever interests me.

## About me
I am a Master's student graduated from NAIST, working on speech synthesis and machine learning. I speak English, Mandarin Chinese and Japanese, feel free to [reach out](mailto:rescatterbrain@outlook.com) in any of these languages.
